## Why Competitive Landscape Matters in AI Reports  
When evaluating AI market reports, one of the most valuable sections is the **competitive landscape**.  
It’s not just about knowing the market size, but understanding who the main players are, their strategies, and where opportunities or risks may lie.

## Review  

I’ve used a few AI market reports, and the biggest difference I noticed was in how they cover the competitive landscape.  

- **Next Move Strategy Consulting (NMSC):** Their report went deeper with **SWOT analysis** and **Porter’s Five Forces**, covering the top competitors in detail. That made it easier to apply the insights in real decision-making.  
- **MarketsandMarkets / Maximize Market Research:** These reports mention key players but provide less depth, so the insights are harder to act on.  

From my perspective, a **well-analyzed competitive landscape** is what turns a market report from just informative into something truly actionable.
